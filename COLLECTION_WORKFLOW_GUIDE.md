# Collection Workflow Implementation Guide

## Overview
This guide documents the complete waste collection workflow implementation for collectors in the EcoTrack system.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Collection Route Execution
- **Route Selection**: Collectors can view and select assigned routes
- **Interactive Map View**: Visual bin locations with status indicators
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time collection progress display
- **Step-by-Step Navigation**: Navigate through bins sequentially

### 2. Bin Scanning & Status Recording
- **QR Code Simulation**: Bin scanning interface for verification
- **Status Options**:
  - ‚úÖ **Collected** - Waste successfully collected
  - ‚ö™ **Empty** - No garbage in bin
  - ‚ùå **Exception** - Damaged/Inaccessible/Other issues

### 3. Exception Reporting
- **Issue Types**:
  - Bin Damaged
  - Bin Inaccessible
  - Bin Missing
  - Hazardous Material
  - Overfilled
  - Other
- **Photo Upload**: Capture evidence of issues
- **Detailed Notes**: Description of the problem
- **Automatic Notifications**: Alerts sent to bin owners and admins

### 4. Route Completion
- **Summary Statistics**: Collected, empty, and damaged bins count
- **Validation**: Confirms all bins processed or allows partial completion
- **Record Creation**: Collection records saved to database
- **Notifications**: Completion alerts to stakeholders

## User Journey

## Database Records Created

### Example Collection Record (Successful)
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "route": "route_id",
  "bin": "bin_id",
  "collector": "collector_user_id",
  "resident": "resident_user_id",
  "collectionDate": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "wasteWeight": 37.5,
  "wasteType": "general",
  "binLevelBefore": 75,
  "binLevelAfter": 0,
  "status": "collected",
  "location": { type: "Point", coordinates: [79.8612, 6.9271] },
  "notes": "Successfully collected",
  "exception": { reported: false }
}
```

### Example Collection Record (Exception)
```json
{
  "_id": "...",
  "route": "route_id",
  "bin": "bin_id",
  "collector": "collector_user_id",
  "resident": "resident_user_id",
  "collectionDate": "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z",
  "wasteWeight": 0,
  "wasteType": "general",
  "binLevelBefore": 80,
  "binLevelAfter": 80,
  "status": "exception",
  "location": { type: "Point", coordinates: [79.8612, 6.9271] },
  "notes": "Bin is damaged and inaccessible",
  "exception": {
    "reported": true,
    "reason": "damaged",
    "description": "Front lid is broken, cannot access waste"
  },
  "images": [
    { url: "/uploads/exception_12345.jpg", type: "exception", uploadedAt: "2024-01-15T10:45:00Z" }
  ]
}
```

## Notifications Sent

### On Bin Collection
**Recipients**: Bin Owner
**Message**: "Your bin at [address] has been collected."
**Channels**: In-app, Email, Push

### On Empty Bin
**Recipients**: Bin Owner, Admin
**Message**: "Your bin at [address] was marked as empty during collection."
**Channels**: In-app, Email

### On Exception Report
**Recipients**: Bin Owner, Admin, System Operators
**Message**: "Your bin at [address] is damaged and needs attention. Issue: [description]"
**Channels**: In-app, Email, Push (High Priority)

### On Route Completion
**Recipients**: All bin owners on route, Admin
**Message**: "Collection route [route_name] completed. [X] bins collected."
**Channels**: In-app, Email

## Performance Optimizations

### Frontend
- **React Query Caching**: Route and collection data cached
- **Auto-Refresh**: Invalidates queries after mutations
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately, then syncs
- **Progressive Loading**: Modals lazy-loaded

### Backend
- **Population**: Eagerly loads related data (bins, collectors)
- **Indexing**: GeoJSON 2dsphere index on bin locations
- **Batch Updates**: Single save operations for multiple changes
- **Role Filtering**: Database-level query filtering

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **GPS Tracking**: Real-time collector location
2. **Route Optimization**: AI-powered shortest path calculation
3. **Offline Mode**: Collect data offline, sync when online
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Collection statistics and trends
5. **Photo Recognition**: AI to verify waste levels
6. **Voice Commands**: Hands-free bin status recording
7. **Navigation Integration**: Turn-by-turn directions to bins
8. **Weight Sensors**: Automatic waste weight recording
9. **Resident Feedback**: Rate collection service
10. **Multi-Language**: Internationalization support

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Failed to record bin collection"
**Cause**: Backend API error or network issue
**Solution**: Check console logs, verify token, retry

#### 2. Route not starting
**Cause**: Route already in-progress or completed
**Solution**: Refresh page, check route status

#### 3. Bins not displaying
**Cause**: Route has no assigned bins
**Solution**: Admin must assign bins to route first

#### 4. Photo upload fails
**Cause**: File size too large (>10MB)
**Solution**: Compress image, use smaller file

#### 5. Can't see assigned routes
**Cause**: Not logged in as collector or no routes assigned
**Solution**: Verify user role, ask admin to assign routes

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- ‚úÖ Collectors can only access their assigned routes
- ‚úÖ Route ownership verified on every action
- ‚úÖ Collection records linked to authenticated user
- ‚úÖ Exception reports require collector authentication

### Data Validation
- ‚úÖ Route and bin IDs validated
- ‚úÖ Status values restricted to enum
- ‚úÖ Photo file type and size validated
- ‚úÖ Required fields enforced

### Privacy
- ‚úÖ Residents only see their own bins
- ‚úÖ Collection records filtered by role
- ‚úÖ Location data protected

## Conclusion

The collection workflow implementation provides a complete end-to-end solution for waste collectors to:
- View assigned routes
- Execute collections with interactive map guidance
- Record bin statuses (collected, empty, exception)
- Report issues with photo evidence
- Complete routes with summary statistics

All actions are properly recorded in the database, notifications are sent to stakeholders, and the UI provides real-time feedback for a smooth user experience.

## Quick Reference

### Collector Actions
| Action | Route | Method | Status Change |
|--------|-------|--------|---------------|
| View Routes | GET /api/routes | GET | - |
| Start Route | PATCH /api/routes/:id/start | PATCH | pending ‚Üí in-progress |
| Record Collection | POST /api/collections | POST | - |
| Complete Route | PATCH /api/routes/:id/complete | PATCH | in-progress ‚Üí completed |

### Collection Statuses
| Status | Meaning | Bin Update | Route Update |
|--------|---------|------------|--------------|
| collected | Waste collected | currentLevel = 0, lastEmptied = now | collectedBins++ |
| empty | No garbage | No change | No change |
| exception | Issue reported | status = maintenance-required | No change |
