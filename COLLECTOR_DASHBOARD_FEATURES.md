# Collector Dashboard - Map & Collection Workflow Features

## Overview
Enhanced the waste collector dashboard with an interactive route map and comprehensive collection workflow system. The features maintain the existing dashboard structure while adding new functionality specifically for collectors.

## Features Implemented

  - Real-time tracking placeholder (ready for map integration)
  - Current location and bin location markers
  - Map overlay controls for navigation and location
  
- **Route Start/End Button**
  - Start Route: Initiates route tracking and enables workflow features
  - End Route: Completes route and resets workflow state
  - Visual feedback with color changes (green to start, red to end)

- **Route Progress Tracker** (shown when route is active)
  - Progress bar showing collection completion percentage
  - Three metrics display:
    - Collected bins count

#### **Step 2: Mark Bin Status**
Three status options with color-coded buttons:
- ✓ **Collected** (Green) - Normal successful collection
- ⊘ **No Garbage** (Yellow) - Empty bin, nothing to collect
- ⚠ **Damaged** (Red) - Bin has issues, triggers exception report

**Features:**
- Status selection modal after bin scan
- Displays bin ID and location
- Auto-updates collection progress
- Visual feedback for each status type

#### **Step 3: Exception Reporting**
Comprehensive issue reporting system for damaged or inaccessible bins.

**Features:**
- Photo upload interface (drag & drop or click)
- Issue type dropdown:
  - Bin Damaged
  - Bin Inaccessible
  - Bin Missing
  - Hazardous Material
  - Other
- Text notes area for detailed description
- Bin context (ID and location) displayed
- Submit with validation

#### **Step 4: Route Completion**
- "Complete Route" button (visible when route is active)
- Confirmation dialog before completion
- Submits comprehensive route completion report
- Resets all workflow states
- Success notification

### 3. **Notifications System**
Ready for integration with backend:
- New route assignments
- Missed bin alerts
- Issue escalations
- Real-time updates

## User Interface Design

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Map Section**: Prominent 2-column display for easy navigation
- **Workflow Panel**: Organized step-by-step process in sidebar
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Blue: Navigation/Scanning
  - Green: Success/Collected
  - Yellow: Warnings/Empty
  - Orange/Red: Issues/Exceptions
  - Purple: Completion actions

### Interactions
- **Disabled State**: Features disabled until route starts
- **Modal Overlays**: Clean, focused interfaces for each action
- **Hover Effects**: Visual feedback on all interactive elements
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and loading states
- **Progress Feedback**: Real-time updates throughout workflow

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Collector workflow states
const [routeStarted, setRouteStarted] = useState(false);
const [currentBin, setCurrentBin] = useState<any>(null);
const [showBinScanner, setShowBinScanner] = useState(false);
const [showStatusModal, setShowStatusModal] = useState(false);
const [showExceptionReport, setShowExceptionReport] = useState(false);
const [collectedBins, setCollectedBins] = useState<string[]>([]);
```

### Components Added
1. **Route Map Container** - Map display with controls
2. **Route Progress Tracker** - Real-time collection metrics
3. **Collection Workflow Cards** - Step-by-step process cards
4. **Bin Scanner Modal** - QR/NFC scanning interface
5. **Bin Status Modal** - Status selection interface
6. **Exception Report Modal** - Issue reporting form

### Icons Used (from lucide-react)
- `Map` - Route map
- `PlayCircle` - Start route
- `Flag` - End/Complete route
- `QrCode` - Bin scanning
- `Camera` - Photo capture
- `Image` - Photo upload
- `Navigation` - GPS/Navigation
- `CheckCircle` - Completion/Success
- `Trash2` - Bin/Collection

## Workflow Process

### Main Flow
1. **Start Route** → Collector clicks "Start Route" button
2. **Navigate to Bin** → Map shows route and bin locations
3. **Scan Bin** → QR code or NFC scan confirms location
4. **Mark Status** → Choose: Collected, No Garbage, or Damaged
5. **Handle Exceptions** → If damaged, add photo and notes
6. **Repeat** → Continue for all bins on route
7. **Complete Route** → Submit completion report

### Edge Cases Handled
- Route must be started before any actions
- All workflow features disabled when route not active
- Confirmation required before route completion
- Exception reporting available at any time during active route
- Clear visual feedback for all states
