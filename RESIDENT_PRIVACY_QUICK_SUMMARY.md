# Resident Privacy Update - Quick Summary

## What Changed?

### ✅ **Bins Page** - Already Working!
Residents already see only their own bins. The backend was already filtering by `createdBy` field.

### ✅ **Dashboard Statistics** - Now Fixed!
Updated backend to show residents only their own statistics:

**Before**:
- Showed all system bins, pickups, tickets, payments
- Showed total user counts

**After**:
- Shows only resident's own bins
- Shows only resident's own pickups
- Shows only resident's own tickets
- Shows only resident's own payments
- Hides user statistics (not relevant to residents)

## Technical Changes

### File: `backend/controllers/analytics.controller.js`

**Added filters**:
```javascript
const binFilter = req.user.role === 'resident' ? { createdBy: req.user.id } : {};
const pickupFilter = req.user.role === 'resident' ? { requestedBy: req.user.id } : {};
const ticketFilter = req.user.role === 'resident' ? { createdBy: req.user.id } : {};
const paymentFilter = req.user.role === 'resident' ? { paidBy: req.user.id } : {};
```

**Applied to all database queries**:
- Bin counts
- Pickup counts  
- Ticket counts
- Payment totals
- User stats (hidden for residents)

## Security

✅ **Backend-enforced** - Cannot be bypassed from frontend
✅ **Role-based** - Different data for different roles
✅ **Automatic** - No frontend changes needed

## Testing

**As Resident**:
1. Login to dashboard
2. Should see only your own bins count
3. Should see only your own pickups
4. Should see only your own tickets/payments

**As Admin/Operator/Collector**:
1. Login to dashboard
2. Should see all system-wide statistics
3. Should see total user counts

## No Frontend Changes Needed!

The frontend already calls the correct APIs. The backend now returns filtered data automatically based on user role.

**Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready to Test
