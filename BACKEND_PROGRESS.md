## 🎯 Key Features Across All Implemented Controllers

### Common Patterns:
1. **Advanced Filtering** - Multiple filter parameters, multi-select, ranges
2. **Search Functionality** - Search across multiple fields
3. **Pagination** - Page, limit, total count
4. **Sorting** - Flexible sort options
5. **Role-Based Access Control** - Different permissions per role
6. **Statistics & Analytics** - Aggregate data for dashboards
7. **Status History** - Track all status changes
8. **Relationships** - Populate related documents
9. **Error Handling** - Consistent error responses
10. **Input Validation** - Data validation and sanitization

### Role-Based Permissions:
- **Resident**: Limited to own data (pickups, payments, tickets, bins)
- **Collector**: Can view assigned work, update statuses
- **Operator**: Full CRUD on most resources
- **Admin**: Full access to everything
- **Authority**: Read access to analytics and reports
