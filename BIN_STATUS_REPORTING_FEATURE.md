# 📦 Bin Status Reporting Feature - Complete Implementation

## ✅ Feature Overview
Collectors can now scan QR codes on bins and report their status during pickups. The system automatically:
- Updates bin status in the database
- Notifies residents about their pickup status
- Records complete history for tracking
- Updates the map in real-time
- Alerts operators for damaged bins

---

## 🎯 Complete Workflow

### 1. **Collector Navigation**
- Login as collector
- View assigned pickups on map
- Navigate to pickup using GPS tracking
- Click "Start" to open Google Maps for turn-by-turn directions

### 2. **QR Code Scanning**
- Click the blue **"Scan QR Code"** button
- QR scanner modal opens
- Scan the bin's QR code
- Click "Confirm Scan" to proceed

### 3. **Bin Status Reporting**
After scanning, select one of three status options:

#### 🟢 **Collected Successfully**
- **Action**: Marks bin as collected and completes pickup
- **Database**: Updates `binStatus='collected'`, `status='completed'`
- **Notification**: Sends success notification to resident
- **Message**: "Your waste has been collected successfully. Thank you for using EcoTrack!"

#### 🟡 **No Waste (Empty)**
- **Action**: Marks bin as empty with no waste found
- **Database**: Updates `binStatus='empty'`, `status='completed'`
- **Notification**: Sends low-priority notification to resident
- **Message**: "No waste was found in your bin during collection. Thank you!"

#### 🔴 **Damaged Bin**
- **Action**: Marks bin as damaged and triggers replacement workflow
- **Database**: Updates `binStatus='damaged'`, `status='completed'`
- **Notifications**: 
  - **Resident**: "Your bin was found damaged. Our team will arrange a replacement. Thank you for your patience."
  - **Operators/Admins**: HIGH PRIORITY alert for immediate bin replacement
- **Priority**: High (urgent action required)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

#### 1. **API Endpoint**
```
PATCH /api/pickups/:id/complete
Authorization: Bearer <token> (collector role required)

Body:
{
  "binStatus": "collected" | "empty" | "damaged",
  "collectorNotes": "Optional notes",
  "images": ["optional image URLs"]
}
```

#### 2. **Database Updates** (`PickupRequest.model.js`)
New fields added:
- `binStatus`: enum ['collected', 'empty', 'damaged']
- `collectorNotes`: String (collector's observations)
- `completionImages`: Array of image URLs
- `statusHistory.binStatus`: Tracks bin status in history

#### 3. **Controller Logic** (`pickup.controller.js`)
The `completePickup` function:
1. Validates `binStatus` parameter
2. Verifies collector is assigned to the pickup
3. Updates pickup status based on bin status
4. Creates resident notification (all statuses)
5. Creates operator/admin notification (damaged only)
6. Records status history with timestamp
7. Returns success message

#### 4. **Notification System**
Automatically sends notifications via:
- In-app notifications
- Email notifications
- SMS notifications (if configured)

### Frontend Components

#### 1. **Service** (`pickup.service.ts`)
```typescript
completePickup(id: string, data: {
  binStatus: 'collected' | 'empty' | 'damaged';
  collectorNotes?: string;
  images?: string[];
})
```

#### 2. **Mutation Hook** (`RoutesPage.tsx`)
```typescript
const completePickupMutation = useMutation({
  mutationFn: ({ id, data }) => pickupService.completePickup(id, data),
  onSuccess: (response) => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['assigned-pickups-map']);
    queryClient.invalidateQueries(['routes']);
    alert(response.message);
  }
});
```

#### 3. **UI Components**
- **QR Scanner Modal**: Blue button, camera interface
- **Bin Status Modal**: Three color-coded status buttons
- **Loading States**: Buttons disabled during API call with "Processing..." text
