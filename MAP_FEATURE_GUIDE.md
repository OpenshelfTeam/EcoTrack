## 🎨 Visual Guide

### Marker Colors:
```
🔴 Red     = Critical (≥80% full) - URGENT
🟠 Orange  = High (60-79% full) - Soon
🟡 Yellow  = Medium (40-59% full) - Monitor
🟢 Green   = Low (<40% full) - OK

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Map Technology:
- **Library**: React-Leaflet (FREE)
- **Tiles**: OpenStreetMap (FREE, no API key)
- **No Usage Limits**: Completely unlimited
- **No Registration**: Works out of the box

### Data Refresh:

## 🚀 Testing Without Real Data

If no bins are available in the database:

1. **Create Test Bins** (via Bins page or API)
2. **Or use seed data** (run backend seed script)
3. **Minimum requirements**:
   - Bin must have valid coordinates
   - Coordinates format: `[longitude, latitude]`
   - Example: `[79.8612, 6.9271]` for Colombo

### Sample Bin Data:
```json
{
  "binId": "BIN001",
  "location": {
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [79.8612, 6.9271],
    "address": "123 Main St, Colombo"
  },
  "capacity": 100,
  "currentLevel": 75,
  "binType": "General Waste",
  "status": "active"
}
```

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

The map is fully responsive:
- **Desktop**: Full-width map with side panels
- **Tablet**: Optimized touch controls
- **Mobile**: Stack layout, swipe to navigate
- Touch gestures: Pinch to zoom, drag to pan

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Collectors:
1. Check map at start of shift
2. Filter by "Critical" to prioritize
3. Use search for specific complaints
4. Mark bins as collected in real-time

### For Route Planning:
1. Filter by capacity levels
2. Group bins by geographic clusters
3. Plan routes to minimize travel
4. Consider traffic patterns

### For Maintenance:
1. Filter by "Damaged" status
2. View exact locations
3. Check last emptied dates
4. Verify bin accessibility

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Map Not Showing:
- Check internet connection (map tiles need internet)
- Verify bins have valid coordinates
- Clear browser cache
- Check console for errors

### Bins Not Appearing:
- Verify filters aren't too restrictive
- Check if bins have location data
- Ensure coordinates are in correct format: `[lng, lat]`
- Try "Reset Filters" button

### Markers Overlapping:
- Zoom in for better view
- Click overlapping markers to see popup list
- Use search to find specific bins
