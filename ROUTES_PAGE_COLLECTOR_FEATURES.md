# Routes Page - Collector Interactive Map & Collection Workflow

## Overview
Enhanced the Routes Page with a fully interactive map view and comprehensive collection workflow system specifically designed for waste collectors. The system guides collectors through their routes with visual feedback, bin scanning, status marking, and exception reporting.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Interactive Map View for Collectors**

#### Route Selection Interface
- **Visual Route Cards** displaying:
  - Route name and area
  - Number of bins to collect
  - Scheduled time window
  - Start button with clear visual cues
- **Filtered Display**: Shows only pending/active routes ready for collection
- **One-Click Start**: Collectors can immediately begin a route

#### Active Route Map Display
- **Grid Layout Map**: Visual representation of all bins in the route
- **Color-Coded Bin Markers**:
  - ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow (Pulsing)**: Current/Next bin to collect
  - ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Successfully collected bins
  - âšª **White**: Pending bins

- **Interactive Bins**: Click any bin to scan/process it

### 2. **Collection Workflow System**

#### Step 1: Route Start
```
Collector selects route â†’ System initiates tracking â†’ Map view loads
```
- Route status changes to "in-progress"
